# NYCDSA Project 1

My goal was to use descriptive analytics to try to understand and describe AI biotech startups trends domestically and globally.

I used two datasets scraped from BenchSci. 

## Contents

Folders 'aidd' and 'aistartups' contain the Scrapy Python code. 

Folder 'data' contains the two csv files.

'decriptive_analytics_of_ai_dd_trends.ipynb' contains exploration and visualizations of the datasets.

'NYCDSAProject1_AIBiotechTrends.pdf' is the presentation for the project.
